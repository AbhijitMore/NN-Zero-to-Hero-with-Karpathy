    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore the foundational concepts of derivatives and their application in building a micro-scale automatic differentiation NN library. We will focus on the essential components needed for manual backpropagation, discuss how to implement backward functionality, and compare our approach with established frameworks like PyTorch. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of the mechanics behind automatic differentiation and how to construct a simple neural network from scratch. This is aimed at learners and practitioners who want to deepen their understanding of these critical concepts without unnecessary complexity.\n",
